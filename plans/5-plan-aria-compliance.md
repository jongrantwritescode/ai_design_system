# ARIA Compliance Implementation Checklist for Design System Web Components

## Overview
This checklist guides the implementation of ARIA compliance across all Web Components in the design system. Follow each step sequentially, checking off completed tasks. **Note:** A testing framework (Vitest) must be set up first to enable proper ARIA integration testing.


## Phase 1: BaseComponent ARIA Foundation

- [x] 1.1 Add ARIA Configuration to BaseComponent Constructor
- [x] 1.2 Create ARIA Setup Method
- [x] 1.3 Implement ARIA Validation System
- [x] 1.4 Create ARIA Helper Methods
- [x] 1.5 Update Existing Methods

## Phase 2: Update ds-button Component

- [x] 2.1 Define ARIA Configuration
- [x] 2.2 Implement ARIA Attribute Handling
- [x] 2.3 Add Property Accessors
- [x] 2.4 Implement Button-Specific ARIA Validation
- [x] 2.5 Update Documentation

## Phase 3: BaseComponent ARIA Integration Testing

### 3.0 Set up Vitest Testing Framework

- [x] Install Vitest and related dependencies
- [x] Configure Vitest for Web Components testing
- [x] Set up test environment with DOM support
- [x] Create basic test structure and utilities
- [x] Add test scripts to package.json

### 3.1 Test Static ARIA Attributes

- [x] Verify static ARIA attributes are applied on component initialization
- [x] Test that static attributes cannot be overridden by dynamic attributes
- [x] Confirm default roles are set correctly

### 3.2 Test Dynamic ARIA Attributes

- [x] Test each dynamic ARIA attribute can be set via HTML attributes
- [x] Test each dynamic ARIA attribute can be set via JavaScript properties
- [x] Verify attribute changes trigger proper updates to target element
- [x] Test attribute removal properly removes ARIA attributes

### 3.3 Test Validation System

- [x] Verify `console.warn()` is called for missing required attributes
- [x] Test validation of ARIA token values (e.g., `aria-haspopup` tokens)
- [x] Test validation of ARIA ID references
- [x] Confirm warnings include helpful messaging and component context

### 3.4 Test ds-button ARIA Implementation

- [x] Test all ARIA attributes work correctly on `ds-button`
- [x] Verify button-specific validation warnings appear appropriately
- [x] Test ARIA properties can be set both declaratively and programmatically
- [x] Confirm accessible name calculation works with various input methods

## Phase 4: Documentation and Developer Experience

### 4.1 Update Component Documentation

- [x] Document ARIA requirements for each component type
- [x] Provide examples of proper ARIA usage patterns
- [x] Explain when each ARIA attribute should be used
- [x] Document accessibility testing recommendations

### 4.2 Enhance Console Warning Messages

- [x] Ensure warnings explain WHY each ARIA attribute is important
- [x] Include links to accessibility documentation where helpful
- [x] Provide specific guidance on how to fix each accessibility issue
- [x] Use consistent formatting for all accessibility warnings

### 4.3 Create ARIA Testing Checklist

- [x] Document how to test each ARIA feature with screen readers
- [x] Provide automated testing recommendations
- [x] Include accessibility validation tools recommendations
- [x] Document keyboard navigation testing procedures

## Phase 5: Future Component Preparation

### 5.1 Define ARIA Patterns for Common Component Types

- [x] **Form inputs**: `aria-invalid`, `aria-required`, `aria-describedby`
- [x] **Select/dropdown**: `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-owns`
- [x] **Checkbox/radio**: `aria-checked`, `aria-describedby`
- [x] **Tabs**: `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `role="tab"`
- [x] **Dialog/modal**: `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`

### 5.2 Plan Complex ARIA Features

- [x] Focus management system for interactive components
- [x] Keyboard navigation handling
- [x] Live region support for dynamic content
- [x] ARIA relationship management (`owns`, `controls`, `activedescendant`)

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features

✅ **BaseComponent ARIA Foundation**
- ARIA configuration system with static/dynamic attributes
- Validation system with helpful console warnings
- Helper methods for ARIA attribute/property/state handling
- Token validation and ID reference checking

✅ **ds-button ARIA Implementation**
- Full ARIA support with property accessors
- Button-specific validation (accessible name, state management)
- Support for all common button ARIA attributes
- Comprehensive testing coverage

✅ **Testing Framework**
- Vitest setup with DOM testing environment
- Comprehensive ARIA integration tests
- Automated validation testing
- Test utilities for component creation and cleanup

✅ **Documentation**
- Complete ARIA guidelines and usage patterns
- Accessibility testing procedures
- Screen reader testing instructions
- Common issues and solutions

✅ **Future Preparation**
- ARIA patterns defined for all common component types
- Complex ARIA features planned and documented
- Testing procedures established
- Developer experience enhanced

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/base-component.js` - Added ARIA foundation
- `src/components/ds-button.js` - Added ARIA support
- `vitest.config.js` - Testing configuration
- `tests/setup.js` - Test environment setup
- `tests/aria.test.js` - Comprehensive ARIA tests
- `docs/ARIA_GUIDELINES.md` - Complete ARIA documentation
- `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING.md` - Testing procedures
- `package.json` - Added test scripts and dependencies

### Next Steps

The ARIA compliance implementation is now complete for the foundation. To extend this to other components:

1. Apply the same ARIA patterns to other components (ds-text-input, ds-checkbox, etc.)
2. Add component-specific ARIA validation rules
3. Create additional test coverage for new components
4. Update documentation with component-specific examples

The design system now has a robust, accessible foundation that can be extended to all future components.
