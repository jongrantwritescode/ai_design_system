# Plans Directory

This directory contains development plans and specifications that were created through an iterative AI-assisted process:

## Creation Process

1. **Initial Planning**: Plans were initially generated using prompt cycles in Gemini
2. **Implementation**: The generated plans were then executed in Cursor using AI assistance
3. **Refinement**: Local prompts and manual corrections were applied to finalize the implementation

## Important Note

While these plans can be executed programmatically, human input and oversight were essential throughout the process:
- **Human Crafting**: The overall plan structure and requirements were crafted by humans
- **AI Assistance**: AI tools were used to generate initial code and specifications
- **Human Review**: All generated content was reviewed, corrected, and refined by humans
- **Final Validation**: Human developers ensured the final implementation met requirements

This hybrid approach combines the efficiency of AI-assisted development with the critical thinking and domain expertise that only humans can provide.
